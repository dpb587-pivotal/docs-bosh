# Ubuntu Trusty Stemcell Release Notes, 3541.x

## 3541.10 (2018-03-27)

- Periodic Ubuntu and CentOS stemcell bump (March 26/27, 2018)


## 3541.9 (2018-03-12)

- Periodic Ubuntu and CentOS stemcell bump (March 12, 2018)


## 3541.8 (2018-03-08)

- Bump bosh-agent to 2.67.1
  - Agent will now respect previously set permissions and owner on sys/run, sys/log and data job directories
  - This should fix stemcell compatibility with Diego/Garden if Agent restarts
    - If you were using 3541.x stemcell for any of your deployments, it's recommended to update your deployments to this version before updating Director since that would cause Agent restart


## 3541.5 (2018-02-22)

- Bump Ubuntu Trusty stemcells for USN-3582-2: Linux kernel (Xenial HWE) vulnerabilities


## 3541.4 (2018-02-15)

- Rolled back custom umask configuration as we found out it was different in some cases (depends on how processes were started)
  - Hardening of /var/vcap/jobs/* is still applied by the agent


## 3541.2 (2018-02-09)

- [breaking] Set default umask to 077 and further harden several /var/vcap/* directories
  - Note that you may have to change your release to adapt to this change
- [breaking] Renamed /var/vcap/bosh/bin/ntpdate to /var/vcap/bosh/bin/sync-time
- [breaking] Stop forwarding SSH events to bosh-agent
  - Agent no longer receives and forwards such events to HM. This should remove a lot of noisy generated by releases that expect a lot of SSH sessions (eg Gitlab). This information will continue to be available in logs forwarded to remote destinations (and locally /var/log/auth.log).
- Fixes `env.bosh.swap_size: 0` to work on more clouds (including GCP)

Misc

- Order stemcell tarballs so that upload-stemcell command can execute faster
- Generate `packages.txt` within stemcell tarball that includes list of installed packages (previously known under different name)
