# Getting Help

Depending on what you're looking for, there may be a few options for you to find more help...


## Documentation

This site is a primary way to find answers and information about how BOSH operates. We continue to add content and information as we add new features and hear feedback. If you notice something missing or are unable to find what you're looking for, please feel free to [let us know](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/docs-bosh/issues/new) so we can improve.


## GitHub

If you are a developer who loves finding answers in code, you may want to refer to some of our [official repositories](ecosystem/official-repositories.md). Since BOSH is open source, you can feel free to look around and even help us improve through pull requests.

You can also refer to the GitHub issues in our [repositories](ecosystem/official-repositories.md) - there is a good chance someone may have experienced a similar issue and there may already be suggestions and more context available.


## Slack

Even if you're not looking to ask a specific question, come join us in our [Cloud Foundry Slack](https://cloudfoundry.slack.com/). If you are new to the community, you'll need to [request an automatic invite](https://slack.cloudfoundry.org/). Once you're logged in, be sure to join us in the [#bosh](https://cloudfoundry.slack.com/messages/C02HPPYQ2/) channel where you can ask questions or just introduce yourself and say hi to the teams.
